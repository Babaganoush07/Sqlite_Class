## General Information
- Has the features I used the most in sqlite3.
- Helps me not have to duplicte lines of code for connecting to sqlite.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9.9
- Sqlite3


## Features
List the ready features here:
- Querry data
- Add, Edit, Update, Search and Delete records in sqlite.
- Add, Edit, Update, Copy and Delete Tables in sqlite.


## Usage
Database object:

`database = 'Test.db'`

Connect to a table:

`table_name = 'test_table'`

`connect = Database(database, table_name)`

Querry the data:

`data = connect.querry()`


## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_. I'm sure there is more to add, but not for any of my needs.
